Dataset containing standardised information about known adverse reactions for 200
FDA-approved drugs using information from the respective Structured Product Labels (SPLs).
This data resulted from a partnership between the United States Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) and the National Library of Medicine.

Structured Product Labels (SPLs) are the documents FDA uses to exchange information
about drugs and other products. For this dataset, SPLs were manually annotated for
adverse reactions at the mention level to facilitate development and evaluation of
text mining tools for extraction of ADRs from all SPLs. The ADRs were then normalised
to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and to the Medical Dictionary for
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).

These data were used for the adverse event challenge at TAC 2017 (Text Analysis Conference)
in four different tasks:
* Task 1: Extract AdverseReactions and related mentions (Severity, Factor, DrugClass,
Negation, Animal). This is similar to many NLP Named Entity Recognition (NER) evaluations.
* Task 2: Identify the relations between AdverseReactions and related mentions (i.e.,
Negated, Hypothetical, and Effect). This is similar to many NLP relation
identification evaluations.
* Task 3: Identify the positive AdverseReaction mention names in the labels.
For the purposes of this task, positive will be defined as the caseless strings
of all the AdverseReactions that have not been negated and are not related by
a Hypothetical relation to a DrugClass or Animal. Note that this means Factors
related via a Hypothetical relation are considered positive (e.g., "[unknown risk]
Factor of [stroke]AdverseReaction") for the purposes of this task. The result of
this task will be a list of unique strings corresponding to the positive ADRs
as they were written in the label.
* Task 4: Provide MedDRA PT(s) and LLT(s) for each positive AdverseReaction (occasionally,
two or more PTs are necessary to fully describe the reaction). For participants
approaching the tasks sequentially, this can be viewed as normalization of the terms
extracted in Task 3 to MedDRA LLTs/PTs. Because MedDRA is not publicly available,
and contains several versions, a standard version of MedDRA v18.1 will be provided
to the participants. Other resources such as the UMLS Terminology Services may be
used to aid with the normalization process.
