This is a template on how to implement a dataset in the biomedical repo.

A thorough walkthrough on how to implement a dataset can be found here:
https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/add_dataset.html

This script corresponds to Step 4 in the Biomedical Hackathon guide.

To start, copy this template file and save it as <your_dataset_name>.py in an appropriately named folder within datasets. Then, modify this file as necessary to implement your own method of extracting, and generating examples for your dataset. 

There are 3 key elements to implementing a dataset:

(1) `_info`: Create a skeletal structure that describes what is in the dataset and the nature of the features.

(2) `_split_generators`: Download and extract data for each split of the data (ex: train/dev/test)

(3) `_generate_examples`: From downloaded + extracted data, process files for the data in a feature format specified in "info".

----------------------
Step 1: Declare imports
Your imports go here; the only mandatory one is `datasets`, as methods and attributes from this library will be used throughout the script.

We have provided some import statements that we strongly recommend. Feel free to adapt; so long as the style-guide requirements are satisfied (Step 5), then you should be able to push your code.

Step 2: Create keyword descriptors for your dataset

The following variables are used to populate the dataset entry. Common ones include:

- `_DATASETNAME` = "your_dataset_name"
- `_CITATION`: Latex-style citation of the dataset
- `_DESCRIPTION`: Explanation of the dataset
- `_HOMEPAGE`: Where to find the dataset's hosted location
- `_LICENSE`: License to use the dataset
- `_URLs`: How to download the dataset(s), by name; make this in the form of a dictionary where <dataset_name> is the key and <url_of_dataset> is the value
- `_VERSION`: Version of the dataset

Then, fill all relevant information to `BuilderConfig` which populates information about the class.

    The following data structures are useful:

    datasets.Features - An instance that defines all descriptors within a feature in an arbitrary nested manner; the "feature" class must strictly adhere to this format. 

    datasets.Value - the type of the data structure (ex: useful for text, PMIDs)

    datasets.Sequence - for information that must be in a continuous sequence (ex: spans in the text, offsets)

    An example is as follows for an ENTITY + RELATION dataset.

    Your format may differ depending on what the dataset is. Please try to keep the extraction as close to the original dataset as possible. If you're having trouble adapting your dataset, please contact the community channels and an organizer will reach out!
