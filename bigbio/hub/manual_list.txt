These are the scripts that need to be manually looked into to convert;
they seem to fail because of usually license/language but otherwise only blurb fails to schema (And this is a multi-subset so we know it will)

- blurb (schema)
- cadec (License)
- codiesp (license)
- mantra_gsc (language)
- mutation_finder (license)
- n2c2_2014_risk_factors (license)
- nagel (license)
- pho_ner (license)
- thomas2011 (license)

The language failures originally were due to multi-language datasets. I have fixed this. Mantra_GSC has a couple of extra uses of _LANGUAGES that make it tricky. It is worth doing this by hand.

The licenses are also simple - they are issues with custom license often taking more than one line. Worth doing the few by hand.
