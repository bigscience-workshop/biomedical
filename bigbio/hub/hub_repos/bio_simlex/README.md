# Dataset Card for Bio-SimLex

## Dataset Description

- **Homepage:** https://github.com/cambridgeltl/bio-simverb
- **Pubmed:** True
- **Public:** True
- **Tasks:** STS


Bio-SimLex enables intrinsic evaluation of word representations. This evaluation can serve as a predictor of performance on various downstream tasks in the biomedical domain. The results on Bio-SimLex using standard word representation models highlight the importance of developing dedicated evaluation resources for NLP in biomedicine for particular word classes (e.g. verbs).
