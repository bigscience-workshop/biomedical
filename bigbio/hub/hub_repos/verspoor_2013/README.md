# Dataset Card for Verspoor 2013

## Dataset Description

- **Homepage:** NA
- **Pubmed:** True
- **Public:** True
- **Tasks:** NER,RE


This dataset contains annotations for a small corpus of full text journal publications on the subject of inherited colorectal cancer. It is suitable for Named Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction tasks. It uses the Variome Annotation Schema,  a schema that aims to capture the core concepts and relations relevant to cataloguing  and interpreting human genetic variation and its relationship to disease, as described in the published literature. The schema was inspired by the needs of the database curators of the International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumours (InSiGHT) database, but is intended to have application to genetic variation information in a range of diseases.
