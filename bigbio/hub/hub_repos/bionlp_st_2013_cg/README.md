# Dataset Card for BioNLP 2013 CG

## Dataset Description

- **Homepage:** https://github.com/openbiocorpora/bionlp-st-2013-cg
- **Pubmed:** True
- **Public:** True
- **Tasks:** EE,NER,COREF


the Cancer Genetics (CG) is a event extraction task and a main task of the BioNLP Shared Task (ST) 2013.
The CG task is an information extraction task targeting the recognition of events in text,
represented as structured n-ary associations of given physical entities. In addition to
addressing the cancer domain, the CG task is differentiated from previous event extraction
tasks in the BioNLP ST series in addressing a wide range of pathological processes and multiple
levels of biological organization, ranging from the molecular through the cellular and organ
levels up to whole organisms. Final test set submissions were accepted from six teams
