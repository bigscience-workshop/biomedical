## Dataset Description

- **Pubmed:** True
- **Public:** True
- **Tasks:** NER,RE


Corpora with specific entities and relationships annotated are essential to train and evaluate text-mining systems that are developed to extract specific structured information from a large corpus. In this paper we describe an approach where a named-entity recognition system produces a first annotation and annotators revise this annotation using a web-based interface. The agreement figures achieved show that the inter-annotator agreement is much better than the agreement with the system provided annotations. The corpus has been annotated for drugs, disorders, genes and their inter-relationships. For each of the drug-disorder, drug-target, and target-disorder relations three experts have annotated a set of 100 abstracts. These annotated relationships will be used to train and evaluate text-mining software to capture these relationships in texts.
