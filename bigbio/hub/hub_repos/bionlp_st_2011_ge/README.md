# Dataset Card for BioNLP 2011 GE

## Dataset Description

- **Homepage:** https://sites.google.com/site/bionlpst/bionlp-shared-task-2011/genia-event-extraction-genia
- **Pubmed:** True
- **Public:** True
- **Tasks:** EE,NER,COREF


The BioNLP-ST GE task has been promoting development of fine-grained information extraction (IE) from biomedical
documents, since 2009. Particularly, it has focused on the domain of NFkB as a model domain of Biomedical IE.
The GENIA task aims at extracting events occurring upon genes or gene products, which are typed as "Protein"
without differentiating genes from gene products. Other types of physical entities, e.g. cells, cell components,
are not differentiated from each other, and their type is given as "Entity".

abstract = {The Genia event task, a bio-molecular event extraction task,
is arranged as one of the main tasks of BioNLP Shared Task 2011.
As its second time to be arranged for community-wide focused
efforts, it aimed to measure the advance of the community since 2009,
and to evaluate generalization of the technology to full text papers.
After a 3-month system development period, 15 teams submitted their
performance results on test cases. The results show the community has
made a significant advancement in terms of both performance improvement
and generalization.},
