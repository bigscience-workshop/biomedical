PubTator Central (PTC, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator/) is a web service for
exploring and retrieving bioconcept annotations in full text biomedical articles. PTC provides
automated annotations from state-of-the-art text mining systems for genes/proteins, genetic
variants, diseases, chemicals, species and cell lines, all available for immediate download. PTC
annotates PubMed (30 million abstracts), the PMC Open Access Subset and the Author Manuscript
Collection (3 million full text articles). Updated entity identification methods and a
disambiguation module based on cutting-edge deep learning techniques provide increased accuracy.
