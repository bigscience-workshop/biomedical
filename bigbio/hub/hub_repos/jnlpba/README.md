# Dataset Card for JNLPBA

## Dataset Description

- **Homepage:** http://www.geniaproject.org/shared-tasks/bionlp-jnlpba-shared-task-2004
- **Pubmed:** True
- **Public:** True
- **Tasks:** NER


The data came from the GENIA version 3.02 corpus (Kim et al., 2003).
This was formed from a controlled search on MEDLINE using the MeSH terms human, blood cells and transcription factors.
From this search 2,000 abstracts were selected and hand annotated according to a small taxonomy of 48 classes based on
a chemical classification. Among the classes, 36 terminal classes were used to annotate the GENIA corpus.
