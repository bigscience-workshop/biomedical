abstract = {This paper presents the Entity Relations (REL) task,
a supporting task of the BioNLP Shared Task 2011. The task concerns
the extraction of two types of part-of relations between a gene/protein
and an associated entity. Four teams submitted final results for
the REL task, with the highest-performing system achieving 57.7%
F-score. While experiments suggest use of the data can help improve
event extraction performance, the task data has so far received only
limited use in support of event extraction. The REL task continues
as an open challenge, with all resources available from the shared
task website.},
