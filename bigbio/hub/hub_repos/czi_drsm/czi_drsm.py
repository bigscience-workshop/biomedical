Research Article document classification dataset based on aspects of disease research. Currently, the dataset consists of three subsets: 

(A) classifies title/abstracts of papers into most popular subtypes of clinical, basic, and translational papers (~20k papers); 
    - Clinical Characteristics, Disease Pathology, and Diagnosis - 
        Text that describes (A) symptoms, signs, or ‘phenotype’ of a disease; 
        (B) the effects of the disease on patient organs, tissues, or cells; 
        (C) the results of clinical tests that reveal pathology (including
        biomarkers); (D) research that use this information to figure out
        a diagnosis.
    - Therapeutics in the clinic - 
        Text describing how treatments work in the clinic (but not in a clinical trial).
    - Disease mechanism - 
        Text that describes either (A) mechanistic involvement of specific genes in disease 
        (deletions, gain of function, etc); (B) how molecular signalling or metabolism 
        binding, activating, phosphorylation, concentration increase, etc.) 
        are involved in the mechanism of a disease; or (C) the physiological 
        mechanism of disease at the level of tissues, organs, and body systems.
    - Patient-Based Therapeutics - 
        Text describing (A) Clinical trials (studies of therapeutic measures being 
        used on patients in a clinical trial); (B) Post Marketing Drug Surveillance 
        (effects of a drug after approval in the general population or as part of 
        ‘standard healthcare’); (C) Drug repurposing (how a drug that has been 
        approved for one use is being applied to a new disease).

(B) identifies whether a title/abstract of a paper describes substantive research into Quality of Life (~10k papers); 
    - -1 - the paper is not a primary experimental study in rare disease
    - 0 - the study does not directly investigate quality of life
    - 1 - the study investigates qol but not as its primary contribution
    - 2 - the study's primary contribution centers on quality of life measures

(C) identifies if a paper is a natural history study (~10k papers). 
`   - -1 - the paper is not a primary experimental study in rare disease
    - 0 - the study is not directly investigating the natural history of a disease
    - 1 - the study includes some elements a natural history but not as its primary contribution
    - 2 - the study's primary contribution centers on observing the time course of a rare disease
    
These classifications are particularly relevant in rare disease research, a field that is generally understudied.
