# Dataset Card for MedQA

## Dataset Description

- **Homepage:** https://github.com/jind11/MedQA
- **Pubmed:** False
- **Public:** True
- **Tasks:** QA


In this work, we present the first free-form multiple-choice OpenQA dataset for solving medical problems, MedQA,
collected from the professional medical board exams. It covers three languages: English, simplified Chinese, and
traditional Chinese, and contains 12,723, 34,251, and 14,123 questions for the three languages, respectively. Together
with the question data, we also collect and release a large-scale corpus from medical textbooks from which the reading
comprehension models can obtain necessary knowledge for answering the questions.
