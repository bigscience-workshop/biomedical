## Dataset Description

- **Homepage:** https://sites.google.com/view/mediqa2019
- **Pubmed:** False
- **Public:** True
- **Tasks:** TXT2CLASS


The MEDIQA challenge is an ACL-BioNLP 2019 shared task aiming to attract further research efforts in Natural Language Inference (NLI), Recognizing Question Entailment (RQE), and their applications in medical Question Answering (QA).
Mailing List: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bionlp-mediqa

The objective of the RQE task is to identify entailment between two questions in the context of QA. We use the following definition of question entailment: “a question A entails a question B if every answer to B is also a complete or partial answer to A” [1]
