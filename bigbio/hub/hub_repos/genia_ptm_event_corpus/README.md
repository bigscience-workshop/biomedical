- **Tasks:** NER,COREF,EE


Post-translational-modiﬁcations (PTM), amino acid modiﬁcations of proteins after translation, are one of the posterior processes of protein biosynthesis for many proteins, and they are critical for determining protein function such as its activity state, localization, turnover and interactions with other biomolecules. While there have been many studies of information extraction targeting individual PTM types, there was until recently little effort to address extraction of multiple PTM types at once in a unified framework.
