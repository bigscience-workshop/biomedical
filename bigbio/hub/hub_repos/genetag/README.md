# Dataset Card for GENETAG

## Dataset Description

- **Homepage:** https://github.com/openbiocorpora/genetag
- **Pubmed:** True
- **Public:** True
- **Tasks:** NER


Named entity recognition (NER) is an important first step for text mining the biomedical literature.
Evaluating the performance of biomedical NER systems is impossible without a standardized test corpus.
The annotation of such a corpus for gene/protein name NER is a difficult process due to the complexity
of gene/protein names. We describe the construction and annotation of GENETAG, a corpus of 20K MEDLINEÂ®
sentences for gene/protein NER. 15K GENETAG sentences were used for the BioCreAtIvE Task 1A Competition..
