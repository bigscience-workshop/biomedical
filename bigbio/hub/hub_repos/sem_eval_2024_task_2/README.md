The statements and evidence are generated by clinical domain experts, clinical trial organisers, and research oncologists from the Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute and the Digital Experimental Cancer Medicine Team. There are a total of (TBD) statements split evenly across the different sections and classes.
## Description
Each Clinical Trial Report (CTR) consists of 4 sections:
Eligibility criteria - A set of conditions for patients to be allowed to take part in the clinical trial
Intervention - Information concerning the type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments being studied.
Results - Number of participants in the trial, outcome measures, units, and the results.
Adverse events - These are signs and symptoms observed in patients during the clinical trial.
For this task, each CTR may contain 1-2 patient groups, called cohorts or arms. These groups may receive different treatments, or have different baseline characteristics.
