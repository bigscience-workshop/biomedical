2	The Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-737 induces regression of solid tumors  and its derivatives are in the early clinical phase as cancer therapeutics; however, it targets Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bcl-w, but not Mcl-1, which induces resistance against apoptotic cell death triggered by ABT-737.	Recently, it has been reported that ABT-737 is not cytotoxic to all tumors cells, and that chemoresistance to ABT-737 is dependent on appreciable levels of Mcl-1 expression, the one Bcl-2 family member it does not effectively inhibit.	3	3	3	3	3
3	Previous studies demonstrated that the decrease level of 5 hmC in tumors was due to the reduced expression of TET1/2/3 and IDH2 genes or tumor derived IDH1 and IDH2 mutations.	In addition, genetic and functional studies suggest that neomorphic IDH mutations contribute to myeloid transformation, at least in part, by inhibiting TET enzymatic function. 	2	2	3	2	2
4	More recently, IDH mutations and resultant 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) production in leukemia cells were reported to induce global DNA hypermethylation through impaired TET2 catalytic function.	It has also been recently reported that mutations of the isocitrate dehydrogenase genes IDH1 and IDH2 can lead to the aberrant production of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), a metabolite that inhibits TET2 enzymatic activity, resulting in a hypermethylated promoter phenotype in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) tumors carrying IDH1/2 mutations.	3	3	4	3	3
5	Recent in vitro studies using shRNA-based approaches have suggested a role for TET2 in regulating myeloid differentiation and in regulating stem/progenitor cell proliferation.	Two recent studies used RNAi-mediated Tet2 knock-down in vitro to suggest that TET2 depletion led to impaired hematopoietic differentiation and to preferential myeloid commitment.	3	3	4	3	3
6	Recently, it was reported that expression of IDH1R132H suppresses TET2 activity and the mutations of IDH1 and IDH2 genes occur in a mutual exclusive manner with that of TET2 gene in AML.	This large-scale study showed that IDH1/IDH2 mutations were mutually exclusive with inactivating TET2 mutations, suggesting that the two types of mutations had similar effects and were thus functionally redundant.	3	3	4	3	3

9	A high percentage of tumor cells that take on immortalized characteristics show telomerase activity and it has been suggested that hTERT expression may be one of the six key events common to cancer.	As a serine/threonine protein kinase, AKT functions by phosphorylating key intermediate signaling molecules, leading to increased cell metabolism, cell growth, cell survival, and cell invasiveness—all hallmarks of cancer.	2	1	1	2	1
10	n view of the evidence that many tumors occurring in nature arise from the selection of cells with genetic and/or epigenetic changes.

15	Several computational target prediction approaches, such as TargetScan, PicTar, miRanda, PITA, DIANA-microT and RNAhybrid, have been developed to predict target genes. 	Three programs, PicTar, miRanda, and TargetScan , were used to predict the targets of miR-21.	2	2	3	2	3
16	Several lines of evidence suggest that the known principal RB pathway lesions in human tumors act in a mutual exclusive manner.	In individual human tumor specimens, these principal components of the pathway—RB-CDK4/6-p16INK4A—are reported to be targeted in a mutually exclusive manner.	3	3	4	3	4
17	The Retinoblastoma protein, pRb, was among the first recognized tumor suppressor proteins, and loss or repression of pRb function is thought to play a causative role in most human cancers.	Mutation of the retinoblastoma tumor susceptibility gene (RB1) is the rate-limiting step in the genesis of retinoblastoma and over 90% of human tumors exhibit reduced pRB function.	3	3	3	3	3
18	For example, loss of, or functional alterations in, the two major tumor suppressor proteins pRB and p53 cause an up-regulation of ribosome biogenesis in cancer tissues.	E2F1 stabilizes p53 by inducing the expression of p19(p14)/ARF, an inhibitor of the mdm2 ubiquitin ligase that targets p53 for proteolysis.	2	2	2	2	2

23	Furthermore, a very recent study demonstrated the mechanism that specifies myeloid expression of miR-223 and proposed a unique “minicircuitry” comprised of miR-223 and transcription factors, NFI-A and CAAT enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) 	miR-223 regulates granulopoiesis by a feedback mechanism and is modulated competitively by the transcription factors nuclear factor I/A (NFI-A) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα).	3	4	4	3	3
24	miR-223 regulates granulopoiesis by a feedback mechanism and is modulated competitively by the transcription factors nuclear factor I/A (NFI-A) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα) 	There is growing evidence from animal systems that miRNA-regulated transcription factors frequently regulate the transcription of their cognate miRNAs.	1	2	2	2	2
25	In myelopoiesis, miR-223 has been shown to regulate granulocyte development in both humans and mice.	As shown previously, miR-223 is highly conserved, and its myeloid-specific expression is also well characterized in both human and mouse 	3	3	4	4	4
26	To clarify the roles of miRNAs in erythropoiesis, four miRNAs were selected (miR-155, miR-221, miR-223, and miR-451) because their expression seems to be relevant to hematopoiesis.	In myelopoiesis, miR-223 has been shown to regulate granulocyte development in both humans and mice.	2	2	2	2	2
27	We then sought to reassess the regulation of miR-223 in the exactly same experimental system adopted in the previous work 	Importantly, our reassessment revealed that this conserved promoter is probably active in the induction of miR-223 during All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced differentiation of the APL cell line, NB4 cells, which is the main experimental system adopted in the previous study 	2	3	3	2	2

43	The overall accuracy of our gene expression classifier was ~88%, and all T-ALL, TEL-AML1-positive, hyperdiploid and E2A-rearranged cases were correctly classified (i.e., 100% sensitivity) which resembled the data previously reported using other strategies for probe set selection and classifier construction.

61	As p16INK4a blocks the inactivation of pRb by cyclin-dependent kinases, and Arf blocks the inactivation of p53 by Mdm2-mediated proteolysis, both have the capacity to cause cell cycle arrest.	By inducing Arf and Ink4a in primary rodent fibroblasts, oncogenic Ras expression leads to growth arrest and premature senescence.	3	3	2	2	2
62	For the analysis of expression at different stages of differentiation, data were obtained for 43 mouse samples in StemBase , originating from 16 studies with Affymetrix MOE430A microarray chips, as used in an Oct4 expression profiling study covering murine ESCs, embryonal carcinoma cell lines, and several early differentiated lineages.

Intriguingly, in the presence of caspase inhibitors or following caspase-8 gene ablation, death receptors have also recently been shown to induce necrotic cell death, a process which is dependent on the kinase activity of RIPK1 and RIPK3	3	3	3	3	2
93	The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor roscovitine has been reported to down-regulate the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1	Recent work in model systems and acute myelogenous leukemia has suggested that expression of MCL-1 is a key determinant of resistance to ABT-737	2	2	2	2	2
94	The up-regulation of miR-146a was also detected in cervical cancer tissues.	The expression of miR-146a has been found to be up-regulated in cervical cancer.	4	4	4	4	4
95	At the onset of mitosis, LATS2 is activated by phosphorylation and plays important roles in G2/M transition in cultured cells	Lats2/Kpm is homologous to Lats1 and undergoes cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation	3	3	3	3	3
96	Ironically, Rest has recently been described as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene.	In human epithelial cells REST has been described as a potent suppressor of malignant transformation and its deregulation has been associated with several non-neural tumors including breast and small cell lung cancers	3	3	3	3	4
97	Alterations in Oct-4 expression promote differentiation and leads to the specification of ectodermal, endodermal or mesodermal primitive progenitors.	OCT4, a transcript of POU5F1, plays a role in maintaining stem cell pluripotency, self-renewal and chromatin structure in stem cells, and promotes tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner.	1	1	1	3	2
98	Three programs, PicTar, miRanda, and TargetScan , were used to predict the targets of miR-21.	The genes that decreased 2-fold or more were further screened for possible miR-372/3 target sites using a local version of the TargetScan algorithm.	2	3	2	3	2
99	The recent reports demonstrated that the first eight nucleotides of the 5′ end of miRNA could correlate with the efficient translational repression.	Mismatches near the 5′ end of the small RNA completely abrogated translational suppression.	3	3	4	3	3
100	Oncogenic KRAS mutations are common in cancer.	Notably, c-Raf has recently been found essential for development of K-Ras-driven NSCLCs.	2	2	1	2	2
