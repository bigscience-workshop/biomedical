# Dataset Card for BioASQ Task B

## Dataset Description

- **Homepage:** http://participants-area.bioasq.org/datasets/
- **Pubmed:** True
- **Public:** False
- **Tasks:** QA


The BioASQ corpus contains multiple question
answering tasks annotated by biomedical experts, including yes/no, factoid, list,
and summary questions. Pertaining to our objective of comparing neural language
models, we focus on the the yes/no questions (Task 7b), and leave the inclusion
of other tasks to future work. Each question is paired with a reference text
containing multiple sentences from a PubMed abstract and a yes/no answer. We use
the official train/dev/test split of 670/75/140 questions.

See 'Domain-Specific Language Model Pretraining for Biomedical
Natural Language Processing'
