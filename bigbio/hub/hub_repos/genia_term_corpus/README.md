# Dataset Card for GENIA Term Corpus

## Dataset Description

- **Homepage:** http://www.geniaproject.org/genia-corpus/term-corpus
- **Pubmed:** True
- **Public:** True
- **Tasks:** NER


The identification of linguistic expressions referring to entities of interest in molecular biology such as proteins,
genes and cells is a fundamental task in biomolecular text mining. The GENIA technical term annotation covers the
identification of  physical biological entities as well as other important terms. The corpus annotation covers the full
1,999 abstracts of the primary GENIA corpus.
