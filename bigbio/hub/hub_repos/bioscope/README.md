# Dataset Card for BioScope

## Dataset Description

- **Homepage:** https://rgai.inf.u-szeged.hu/node/105
- **Pubmed:** True
- **Public:** True
- **Tasks:** NER


The BioScope corpus consists of medical and biological texts annotated for
negation, speculation and their linguistic scope. This was done to allow a
comparison between the development of systems for negation/hedge detection and
scope resolution. The BioScope corpus was annotated by two independent linguists
following the guidelines written by our linguist expert before the annotation of
the corpus was initiated.
