# Dataset Card for GAD

## Dataset Description

- **Homepage:** https://geneticassociationdb.nih.gov/
- **Pubmed:** True
- **Public:** True
- **Tasks:** TXTCLASS


A corpus identifying associations between genes and diseases by a semi-automatic
annotation procedure based on the Genetic Association Database.

## Note about homepage

The homepage for this dataset is no longer reachable, but the url is recorded here.
Data for this dataset was originally downloaded from a google drive
folder (the link used in the [BLURB benchmark data download script](https://microsoft.github.io/BLURB/submit.html).
