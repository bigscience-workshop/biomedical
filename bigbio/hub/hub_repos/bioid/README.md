# Dataset Card for Bio-ID

## Dataset Description

- **Homepage:** https://biocreative.bioinformatics.udel.edu/tasks/biocreative-vi/track-1/
- **Pubmed:** True
- **Public:** True
- **Tasks:** NER,NED 


The Bio-ID track focuses on entity tagging and ID assignment to selected bioentity types.
The task is to annotate text from figure legends with the entity types and IDs for taxon (organism), gene, protein, miRNA, small molecules,
cellular components, cell types and cell lines, tissues and organs. The track draws on SourceData annotated figure
legends (by panel), in BioC format, and the corresponding full text articles (also BioC format) provided for context.
