ChEBI Chapti contains the results of a collaboration between the European Patent Office and
the ChEBI team. The goal of the project was to identify chemicals within patents and cross-
reference them to ChEBI. The teams manually annotated chemicals in a set of 40 patents.
This was used to measure the performance of the various text-mining tools. This set of
40 patents is distributed in this directory. The results of this work can be seen on the ChEBI
website.
