# Dataset Card for BioNLP 2019 BB

## Dataset Description

- **Homepage:** https://sites.google.com/view/bb-2019/dataset
- **Pubmed:** True
- **Public:** True
- **Tasks:** NER,NED,RE


The task focuses on the extraction of the locations and phenotypes of
microorganisms from PubMed abstracts and full-text excerpts, and the
characterization of these entities with respect to reference knowledge
sources (NCBI taxonomy, OntoBiotope ontology). The task is motivated by
the importance of the knowledge on biodiversity for fundamental research
and applications in microbiology.
