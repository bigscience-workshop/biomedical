- **Pubmed:** True
- **Public:** True
- **Tasks:** NER,NED,TXTCLASS


NLM-Chem corpus consists of 150 full-text articles from the PubMed Central Open Access dataset,
comprising 67 different chemical journals, aiming to cover a general distribution of usage of chemical
names in the biomedical literature.
Articles were selected so that human annotation was most valuable (meaning that they were rich in bio-entities,
and current state-of-the-art named entity recognition systems disagreed on bio-entity recognition.
