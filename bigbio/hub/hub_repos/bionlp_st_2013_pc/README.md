# Dataset Card for BioNLP 2013 PC

## Dataset Description

- **Homepage:** https://github.com/openbiocorpora/bionlp-st-2013-pc
- **Pubmed:** True
- **Public:** True
- **Tasks:** EE,NER,COREF


the Pathway Curation (PC) task is a main event extraction task of the BioNLP shared task (ST) 2013.
The PC task concerns the automatic extraction of biomolecular reactions from text.
The task setting, representation and semantics are defined with respect to pathway
model standards and ontologies (SBML, BioPAX, SBO) and documents selected by relevance
to specific model reactions. Two BioNLP ST 2013 participants successfully completed
the PC task. The highest achieved F-score, 52.8%, indicates that event extraction is
a promising approach to supporting pathway curation efforts.
