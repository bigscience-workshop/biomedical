BioASQ Task B On Biomedical Semantic QA (Involves IR, QA, Summarization qnd
More). This task uses benchmark datasets containing development and test
questions, in English, along with gold standard (reference) answers constructed
by a team of biomedical experts. The participants have to respond with relevant
concepts, articles, snippets and RDF triples, from designated resources, as well
as exact and 'ideal' answers.

The data are intended to be used as training and development data for BioASQ 6,
which will take place during 2018. There is one file containing the data:
 - BioASQ-trainingDataset6b.json

Differences with BioASQ-trainingDataset5b.json
- 500 new questions added from BioASQ5
    - 48 pairs of questions with identical bodies have been merged into one
    question having only one question-id, but all the documents, snippets,
    concepts, RDF triples and answers of both questions of the pair.
        - This normalization lead to the removal of 48 deprecated question
        ids [2] from the dataset and to the update of the 48 remaining
        questions [3].
        - In cases where a pair of questions with identical bodies had some
        inconsistency (e.g. different question type), the inconsistency has
        been solved merging the pair manually consulting the BioASQ expert team.
    - 12 questions were revised for various confusions that have been
    identified
        - In 8 questions the question type has been changed to better suit to
        the question body. The change of type lead to corresponding changes
        in exact answers existence and format : 54fc4e2e6ea36a810c000003,

        52f65f372059c6d71c000027
		- In 6 questions the ideal answer has been revised :
        532aad53d6d3ac6a34000010, 5710ade4cf1c32585100002c,

        5509bd6a1180f13250000002, 58bbb71f22d3005309000016
		- In 5 questions the exact answer has been revised :
        5314bd7ddae131f847000006, 53130a77e3eabad02100000f,
        53148a07dae131f847000002, 53147b52e3eabad021000015,
        5147c8a6d24251bc05000027
		- In 2 questions the question body has been revised :
        52f65f372059c6d71c000027, 5503145ee9bde69634000022
    - In lists of ideal answers, documents, snippets, concepts and RDF triples
    any duplicate identical elements have been removed.
    - Ideal answers in format of one string have been converted to a list with
    one element for consistency with cases where more than one golden ideal
    answers are available. (i.e. "ideal_ans1" converted to ["ideal_ans1"])
    - For yesno questions: All exact answers have been normalized to "yes" or
    "no" (replacing "Yes", "YES" and "No")
    - For factoid questions: The format of the exact answer was normalized to a
    list of strings for each question, representing a set of synonyms
    answering the question (i.e. [`ans1`, `syn11`, ... ]).
    - For list questions: The format of the exact answer was normalized to a
    list of lists. Each internal list represents one element of the answer
    as a set of synonyms
    (i.e. [[`ans1`, `syn11`, `syn12`], [`ans2`], [`ans3`, `syn31`] ...]).
    - Empty elements, e.g. empty lists of documents have been removed.
