    "#### Last Updated: 2022.07.05\n",
    "\n",
    "The following tutorial will show you how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Generate prompts using the specific `BigBio` fork of *PromptSource*. <br>\n",
    "(2) Generate a new prompt task in `LmEval` <br>\n",
    "(3) Evaluate a model of choice for your dataset!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the dataset `Biosses` within BigBio and treating this as a \"custom\" dataset to illustrate how to use PromptSource and Lm-Eval-Harness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE** This tutorial uses 3 packages: `promptsource`, `lm-eval-harness` and `bigbio`. All of these need to be installed (instructions will be provided) but will require some work outside of the notebook in order to run. Also note, while the prompting templates + bigbio may work as intended, `lm-eval-harness` may not have all the metrics or specifications required for your custom implementation. You may need to add these manually. Feel free to contact us if you need specific help, as these packages are independently maintained, but we are happy to help. "
