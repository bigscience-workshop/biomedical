"""
A dataset loader for the n2c2 2011 coref dataset.

https://portal.dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/projects/n2c2-nlp/

The dataset consists of four archive files,

* Task_1C.zip
* Task_1C_Test_groundtruth.zip
* i2b2_Partners_Train_Release.tar.gz
* i2b2_Beth_Train_Release.tar.gz

The individual data files (inside the zip and tar archives) come in 4 types,

* docs (*.txt files): text of a patient record
* concepts (*.txt.con files): entities used as input to a coreference model
* chains (*.txt.chains files): chains (i.e. one or more) coreferent entities
* pairs (*.txt.pairs files): pairs of coreferent entities (not required)


The files comprising this dataset must be on the users local machine
in a single directory that is passed to `datasets.load_datset` via
the `data_dir` kwarg. This loader script will read the archive files
directly (i.e. the user should not uncompress, untar or unzip any of
the files). For example, if the following directory structure exists
on the users local machine,


n2c2_2011_coref
├── i2b2_Beth_Train_Release.tar.gz
├── i2b2_Partners_Train_Release.tar.gz
├── Task_1C_Test_groundtruth.zip
└── Task_1C.zip

_DESCRIPTION = """\
The i2b2/VA corpus contained de-identified discharge summaries from Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center, Partners Healthcare, and University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center (UPMC). In addition, UPMC contributed de-identified progress notes to the
i2b2/VA corpus. This dataset contains the records from Beth Israel and Partners.

The i2b2/VA corpus contained five concept categories: problem, person, pronoun,
test, and treatment. Each record in the i2b2/VA corpus was annotated by two
independent annotators for coreference pairs. Then the pairs were post-processed
in order to create coreference chains. These chains were presented to an adjudicator,
who resolved the disagreements between the original annotations, and added or deleted
annotations as necessary. The outputs of the adjudicators were then re-adjudicated, with
particular attention being paid to duplicates and enforcing consistency in the annotations.
