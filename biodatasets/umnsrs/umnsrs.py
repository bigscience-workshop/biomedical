UMNSRS, developed by Pakhomov, et al., consists of 725 clinical term pairs whose semantic similarity and relatedness.
The similarity and relatedness of each term pair was annotated based on a continuous scale by having the resident touch
a bar on a touch sensitive computer screen to indicate the degree of similarity or relatedness. The Intraclass
Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for the reference standard tagged for similarity was 0.47, and 0.50 for relatedness.
Therefore, as suggested by Pakhomov and colleagues, the subset below consists of 401 pairs for the similarity set and
430 pairs for the relatedness set which each have an ICC equal to 0.73.
