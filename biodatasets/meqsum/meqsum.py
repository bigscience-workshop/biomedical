"""
Dataset for medical question summarization introduced in the ACL 2019 paper "On the Summarization of Consumer Health
Questions". Question understanding is one of the main challenges in question answering. In real world applications,
users often submit natural language questions that are longer than needed and include peripheral information that
increases the complexity of the question, leading to substantially more false positives in answer retrieval. In this
paper, we study neural abstractive models for medical question summarization. We introduce the MeQSum corpus of 1,000
summarized consumer health questions.
