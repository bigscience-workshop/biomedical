# BigBIO: Biomedical Dataset Library

`BigBIO` (BigScience Biomedical) is an open library of biomedical dataloaders built using Huggingface's (ðŸ¤—) [`datasets` library](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/) for data-centric machine learning. 

Our goals include:

- Lightweight, programmatic access to biomedical datasets at scale
- Promoting reproducibility in data processing
- Better documentation for dataset provenance, licensing, and other key attributes
- Easier generation of meta-datasets for natural language prompting, multi-task learning

Currently `BigBIO` provides support for:

- 126+ biomedical datasets
- 10+ languages
- 12 task categories
- Harmonized dataset schemas by task type
- Metadata on *licensing*, *coarse/fine-grained task types*, *domain*, and more!

## How to Use `BigBIO`

The preferred way to use these datasets is to access them from the [Official `BigBIO` Hub](https://huggingface.co/bigbio). 


Minimally, ensure you have the `datasets` library installed. Preferably, install the requirements as follows:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`.

<br>

You can access `BigBIO` datasets as follows:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
data = load_dataset("bigbio/biosses")
```

In most cases, scripts load the original schema of the dataset by default. You can also access the `BigBIO` split that streamlines access to key information in datasets given a particular task. 

<br>

For example, the `biosses` dataset follows a `pairs` based schema, where text-based inputs (sentences, paragraphs) are assigned a "translated" pair. 

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
data = load_dataset("bigbio/biosses", name="biosses_bigbio_pairs")
```

Generally, you can load your datasets as follows:

```python
# Load original schema
data = load_dataset("bigbio/<your_dataset>")

# Load BigBIO schema
data = load_dataset("bigbio/<your_dataset_here>", name="<your_dataset>_bigbio_<schema_name>")
```

Check the datacards on the Hub to see what splits are available to you. You can find more information about [schemas](task_schemas.md) in [Documentation](##Documentation) below.

## Benchmark Support

`BigBIO` includes support for almost all datasets included in other popular English biomedical benchmarks.
