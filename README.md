# Biomedical Language Modeling

Tools for curating biomedical training data for large-scale language modeling. 

## Contributing
We are always on the lookout for more biomedical data sets. Check out [the guide on how to using data sets and adding new ones](/dataloader/README.md).

## Setup

Using `conda`:

```console
conda env create -f conda.yml
```

Activate the environment as:

```console
conda activate bigscience-biomedical
```

## Datasets
